## Configs

My Linux configs. Included is cmg is a small script to manage symbolic links.
Each config has a comment including the actual path to the file. For example
bashrc contains:

    # [cmgr] .bashrc

Several of the functions in my bashrc are sourced from this [thread][1] on the
Arch Linux forums. In particular:

- [tputcolors is by Gen2ly][2]
- aur is based on [brisbin33's aurget][3]
- cpf, mvf, goto by [drcouzelis and brisbin33][4]
- cfg based on Peasantoid's Python [string manager][5]
- [define is by gadamat][6]
- yt is from [this YouTube video][7]
